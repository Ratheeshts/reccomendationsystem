# reccomendationsystem

	This is a recommender system for e-Leaning
personalization based on learners learning activities and
performance. It means personalization approach for giving
learning resources for active learners in the e-Learning
system. This system recommends some learning resources
based on learner’s profile, level of knowledge, and some
other learner’s activities. Also, the system provides the
ability to track learner achievement based on practical tests
and exercises and observe the learner’s performance in
order to supervise and support the learners.

The aim of our recommender system is to recommend
useful and interesting learning resources to learners based
on their preferences in the e-learning context. The system
was organized using three basic components: Learner
Model, Domain Model, and Recommender Model. This application 
will be developed in Python - DJango
